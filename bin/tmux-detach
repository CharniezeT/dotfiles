# Since I have tmux running automatically, there's no way to exit it and get a
# regular Bash shell. I don't need that often, but sometimes it's useful for
# debugging or when upgrading tmux. Run this to detach tmux and prevent it
# loading on the next login. (An alternate would be to not use exec - see
# http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/67269 - but I'd rather not have the extra
# processes running.)
touch $HOME/.no_tmux
tmux detach
